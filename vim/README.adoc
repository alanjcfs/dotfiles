This repo was created so I can have the same Vim configuration
on multiple machines.

== Installation ==

It comes installed with https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug[junegunn's Vim Plug], a
minimalist vim plugin manager. In summary, you don't need to clone a repo to
to start installing the plugins.

Just clone and run `:PlugInstall`

You're done.
